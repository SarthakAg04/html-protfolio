<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Sarthak Agarwal, and I am currently studying at MCKV College, 
  where I'm continuing my education while also exploring my passions. 
  Before this, I completed my schooling at Douglas Memorial Higher Secondary School, 
  where I developed a strong academic foundation and also honed my interests in creative fields. 
  Throughout my journey, I've always aimed to blend education with personal growth, which has led me to pursue 
  freelancing opportunities.</p>

<p>Alongside my studies, I work as a freelance video editor. This role has allowed me to cultivate my skills in the world of digital media, from editing footage to creating captivating stories. The flexibility of freelancing gives me the freedom to work on diverse projects, which keeps me engaged and constantly learning. Video editing is more than just a profession for me; it's a creative outlet that lets me express my ideas and connect with different people across the globe.</p>

<p>Beyond academics and work, I have a deep love for the mountains and travel. Natureâ€™s tranquility, especially in the mountains, has always been a source of inspiration for me. I often take time to explore new places, whether it's a weekend getaway or an adventurous trek. Traveling broadens my horizons, and each trip offers new perspectives, enriching my personal and professional life. This blend of creativity, education, and exploration defines who I am and what I aspire to achieve in life.</p>
